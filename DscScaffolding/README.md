Project template for creating PowerShell Desired State Configurations.

A basic understanding of PowerShell Desired State Configurations is required for this project template.  Read https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview before continuing.


## Structure

### .vscode
Configures project-specific settings in VS Code to help avoid common PowerShell issues.

### Definitions
This is where configs are placed.  For a service "MyService", flighting ring "DEV", and config type "parameters.json", the first existing config will be chosen in the following order:
1. MyService.DEV.parameters.json
1. MyService.parameters.json
1. Default.DEV.parameters.json
1. Default.parameters.json

More information on Azure Resource Manager templates: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-create-first-template

#### Supported Config Types
* template.json -- for Azure Resource Manager templates
* parameters.json -- for Azure Resource Manager template parameters
* ps1 -- for DSCs 
* psd1 -- for [DSC config data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/separatingenvdata)


### Modules
When developing a custom DSC, all resources must be placed in a module.  There are many community modules listed and documented on https://github.com/PowerShell/, and installable from the PowerShell gallery with `Install-Module`.  Custom resources must be defined in custom modules.  For development convenience, the Modules folder is added to the PowerShell module search path (`$env:PSModulePath`) with `Initialize-LocalEnvironment.ps1` script, enabling linting, validation, and packaging the DSC for deployment.  

More information about defining custom DSC modules and resources is available in `.\Modules\README.md`.

### Scripts
Scripts for dev environment creation, build validation, and deployment are placed here.  Typically, these are convience scripts wrapping the `Cluster` module.

### .gitignore
Ensures user-specific files are not saved to the git repository.

### LICENSE
Must travel with all copies/forks of this repo to ensure compliance with Microsoft's Open Source policy.  More information at opensource.ms.

### PSScriptAnalyzerSettings.psd1
Custom settings for the PowerShell static analysis engine, "PSScriptAnalyzer".  When run, PSScriptAnalyzer will first ensure that your project has no syntax or module import errors, then ensure your code follows some common style, safety, and security practices.  The declarative nature of DSCs makes static analysis extra beneficial.

PSScriptAnalyzer errors can almost always be detected and resolved using VS Code linting alone.  To get a complete print out of PSScriptAnalyzer issues, run `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer . -Recurse` in the repo root.


# Set up

1. Install VS Code
1. Install msazurermtools and ms-vscode.powershell
1. Run the `.\Scripts\Initialize-LocalEnvironment.ps1` script to configure your PSModulePath and install required modules
1. Close any open VS Code windows, then open the project in VS Code
